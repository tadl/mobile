=====================

The visual feedback plugin alows you to create interfaces that are responsive to the user touch.

You can use it to just let your users know where they touched or clicked on their touch screens exactly. It can also be used as a feedback for progress operations (e.g.: let your finger on the screen to load data)

The visual feedback plugin runs on iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Bada and WP
